        <h2>Day 5: Hashmap</h2>
        <p class="date">2025-02-17(If you notice the gaps in dates, that's because I take one day off every week:)</p>
        <h3>📌 Problem 1: 242. Valid Anagram</h3>
    <p>Use hashmap when you want to know if an element is in the list. If you want to further know how many of them, use defaultdict() or Counter()</p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
            a_count = Counter(s)
            b_count = Counter(t)
            return a_count == b_count
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>✅ <b>Thoughts:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Counter() traverses the list and give you all the unique elements and their frequency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📌 Problem 2: 349. Intersection of Two Arrayst</h3>
    <p>I'm providing two solutions for both situations: allow duplicates and not allow.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    m1 = defaultdict(int)
    m2 = defaultdict(int)
    res = []
    for i in nums1:
        m1[i] +=1
    for j in nums2:
        m2[j] +=1
    for i in m1:
        if i in m2:
            # If we only need the unique values in the intersection
            res += [i] 
            # If we nedd all the intersection no matter what
            res += [i]*min(m1[i],m2[i])
    return res
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>✅ <b>Tricks:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's giving O(m+n) but idk why I only beat 23.128% 🤷 </li>
        <li>I mean it's as fast as the popular solution list(set(nums1) & set(nums2))... maybe less simplicity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📌 Problem 3: 202. Happy Number</h3>
    <p>When you need to decide if there's a loop, do the membership check; when you do membership check, map is the fastest.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Solution:
        def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
            s = 0
            past = []
            while n not in past:
                past.append(s)
                s = 0
                for i in list(str(n)):
                    s += int(i)**2
    
                if s==1:return True
                n = s 
            return False
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>✅ <b>Alwayas use map:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you need to decide if an element is in there. So using past = set() shall give you O(1) look-up time.</li>
        <li>Using a list in this case beats 100% while using a set beats 7%... This is counter-intuitive?</li>
        <li>🔥 So Why is the List Sometimes Faster?</li>

        <li> 1️⃣ Small Input Size → List is More Memory Efficient
                •	For small input sizes, Python’s list operations are optimized and require less overhead than a set.
                •	Set operations have a fixed overhead for hashing and handling collisions, which might make it slower than a simple list traversal.</li>
            
        <li>2️⃣ Append is Always O(1) in a List
                •	.append() in a list is always O(1).
                •	A set must compute a hash before adding an element, which introduces some overhead.</li>
            
        <li>3️⃣ CPU Cache & Locality of Reference
                •	Lists store elements sequentially in memory, while sets use a hash table with separate memory allocations.
                •	For small numbers of elements, iterating over a small list can be faster than hashing each item.</li>
            
        <li> 4️⃣ Python’s Built-in Optimizations
                •	Python’s set operations have extra bookkeeping that isn’t worth it for small-sized lists.
                •	If n stays below 10-20 elements, a list might outperform a set due to the overhead of hash computations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📌 Problem 4: 1. Two Sum </h3>
    <p>Isn't it beautifully done with map? It's the first problem for a reason.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
            m = defaultdict(int)
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if target-nums[i] in m:
                    return [m[target-nums[i]], i]
                m[nums[i]] = i
    return res
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>✅ <b>Good thing:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You don't have to go for two loops since you've already added new numbers and their index to the map when you're checking if they form pairs. </li>
    </ul>
